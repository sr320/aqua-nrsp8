Catherine Purcell discussed extending the Aquaculture workshop to include a second day that would have presentations on new species such as yellowtail and abalone. We were reminded that all workshops are encouraged to end by noon on Sunday so that all animal researchers can attend the joint NRSP8 workshop. Catherine has volunteered to encourage applications and will work with Geoff to incorporate this idea into next year’s meeting.
